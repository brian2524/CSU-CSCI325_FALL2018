# Donation Tracker

A GUI menu-driven Java application made for counting up weekly donations at a Church. It allows entry and retrieval of weekly contributions to a local church. The program should allow the user to print a report listing each donor and the amount and ministry area for the current week and a summary page with total weekly deposit information. The purpose of this program is to allow the counters to communicate efficiently with the treasurer of the church while allowing them to access the current weekâ€™s donor information.
